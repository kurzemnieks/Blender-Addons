# Blender-Addons
Different useful addons for Blender

# Python_panel_28.py
Adds UI to 3d viewport side (T) menu to run python scripts from 3D viewport context - this allows using different operators, that require viewport context, without cumbersome context overloading. 

# Hierarchy Tools
Adds some useful hierarchy manipulation operators to Blender - grouping all selected objects under new Empty object, Moving Parent object to center of children or 3D cursor. Basic parenting operation that does not generate the hidden inverse matrix.
